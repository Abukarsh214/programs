Most nurses feel gratified<br> by helping others in need, and having the ability to make a difference<br> in their patients’ lives.</p>
        <p>Others are proud of their career, and enjoy the<br> flexibility of the job. If you are considering a nursing career, you can<br> look forward to many benefits – both personally and professionally.<br> The question is, where do you begin?</p>
